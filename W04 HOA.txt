1. Chapter 6. Redirection 

	1.1 Redirect the output of ls -l command to a file named "output.txt"
ls -l > output.txt
	1.2 Display the content of "output.txt" file
less output.txt
	1.3 Enter the command "ls -l top" and redirect the error message to a file named 		"error.txt"
ls -l top 2> error.txt
	1.4 Display the content of "error.txt" file 
less error.txt
	1.5 Display the content of "output.txt" using cat command with redirection
cat < output.txt
	1.6 Redirect the output of a date command to output.txt without overwriting the file
date >> output.txt
	1.7 Verify that the output of the date command is appended to "output.txt" file
less output.txt
	1.8 Type the command "ls -R /var/tmp" and redirect both the stdout and stderr to the 	file named "output2.txt"
ls -R /var/tmp &> output2.txt
less output2.txt
	1.9 Type the command "ls -R /var/tmp" and redirect the stdout to "out.txt" and the 		stderr to "error.txt" at the same time  
ls -R /var/tmp 1> out.txt 2> error.txt
	1.10 Type the command "ls -R /var/tmp" and redirect any errors to the blackhole
ls -R /var/tmp 2> /dev/null
	1.11 Display the content of "/var/log/syslog" file using cat command and pipe the 		output to less command 
cat /var/log/syslog | less
	1.12 Display the content of "/var/log/syslog" file using cat command and filter the 	output so that only those lines that include the word "systemd" will be displayed
cat /var/log/syslog | grep systemd
	1.13 Display only the first 20 results of the command given in the step above
cat /var/log/syslog | grep systemd | head -n 20
	1.14 Display only the last 10 results of the command given in Step 1.12
cat /var/log/syslog | grep systemd | tail -n 10
	1.15 Display the content of "/var/log/syslog" file using cat command and filter the 	output so that only those lines with the word "error" or "Error" (case insensitive) 	will be displayed on the terminal as well as saved to a file named "result.txt" 
cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i error | tee result.txt
less result.txt
	1.16 Using the cat command and redirection, create a file called "ships" with the 		following lines of text:
cat > ships
Enterprise 
Millennium_Falcon
Apollo 
Enterprise
Orion
^d
      
	1.17 Display only the unique lines in the "ships" file you created in the step above
cat ships | sort | uniq 


2. Chapter 7. Seeing the World as the Shell Sees it

	2.1 Use the echo command, display the message "Good Afternoon"
echo Good Afternoon
	2.2 Using the echo command and brace expansion, display the words "DayA DayB DayC"
echo Day{A..C}
	2.3 Using the brace expansion, create 3 directories named "test1" "test2" and "test3" 
mkdir test{1..3}
	2.4 Using the brace expansion, create files "fun1" "fun2" and "fun3" in each directory 	you created in the previous step.  Do it with one command.
touch test{1..3}/fun{1..3}
ls test{1..3}
	2.5 Using the echo command and pathname expansion, list all files and directories in 	your home directory that start with a capital D
echo D*
	2.6 Using the echo command and pathname expansion, list all files and directories in 	your home directory that end with a letter s
echo *s
	2.7 Using the echo command and pathname expansion, list all files and directories in 	your home directory that start with an uppercase letter
echo [[:upper:]]*
	2.8 Using the echo command and variable expansion, display your current working 		directory
echo $(pwd)
	2.9 Create a variable named "sample1" and give it a value of 5. Then create a 		variable named "sample2" and give it a value of 7
sample1=5 sample2=7
	2.10 Using the echo command and arithmetic expansion, add sample1 and sample2 		together and display the sum
echo $((sample1 + sample2))
	2.11 Using the echo command and arithmetic expansion, multiply sample1 and sample2 		and display the product
echo $((sample1 * sample2))
	2.12 Using the echo command and arithmetic expansion, divide sample1 by sample2 and 	display the quotient
echo $((sample1 / sample2))
	2.13 Use the echo command and the escape sequence, display the following string:
	$ 8.00 / hour (that's my hourly wage) * 8 hours * 5 days = $ 350.00 / week (did I do 	the math right?)
echo "\$ 8.00 / hour (that's my hourly wage) * 8 hours * 5 days = \$ 350.00 / week (did I do 	the math right?)"
	2.14 Using the echo command, display the following equation (Do not display the 		result of the math. Display the equation itself):
 	$(( $sample1 + $sample2 )) 
echo '$(( $sample1 + $sample2 ))'
