CIT 112 Hands-on Application Activity 
Week 09

1 Chapter 24 Writing you first script

	1.1. 	Using vi, create a bash script called script1.sh that displays the following two 		lines. 

	My favorite food is
	My favorite dessert is

vi script1.sh
cat <<- _EOF_
My favorite food is
My favorite dessert is
_EOF_

	1.2 	Run your script1.sh using the source method
source script1.sh
	1.3 	Run your script1.sh using the . method
. script1.sh
	1.4 	Run your script1.sh in a child bash shell
bash script1.sh
	1.5 	Make your script1.sh executable for the owner, group, and other  
chmod 755 script1.sh
	1.6 	Run your script1.sh as an executable file.	
 ./script1.sh
	1.7 	Paste the content of script1.sh here

#! /bin/bash

cat <<- _EOF_
My favorite food is

_EOF_


2 Chapter 25 Starting a project 

	You will create a bash script which performs the following tasks:
	1. Define variables for your favorite food and dessert
	2. Display your favorite food and desert
	3. Display the current date
	4. Display the calendar of the current month

	When it is run, the output should look similar to the one shown below:

	My favorite food is tacos
	My favorite dessert is chocolate chip cookies
	Today's date is Wed 28 Apr 2021 01:25:55 PM MDT
	Here is the calendar of this month
	     April 2021       
	Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
	             1  2  3  
	 4  5  6  7  8  9 10  
	11 12 13 14 15 16 17  
	18 19 20 21 22 23 24  
	25 26 27 28 29 30     

	2.1 	Copy script1.sh to script2.sh.  Using vi, edit script2.sh and define variables, 		food and dessert.  Assign your favorite food and dessert of your choice to those 		variables. (No need to paste the commands for steps 2.1 through 2.4)
cp script1.sh script2.sh
	2.2 	Display your favorite food and dessert

	2.3 	Display the current date

	2.4 	Display the calendar of the current month

	2.5 	Run you script and make sure it displays correctly.  Paste the output.
. script2.sh

cat <<- _EOF_
My favorite food is $FOOD
My favorite dessert is $DESSERT
Today's date is $DATE
Here is the calendar of this month:

3 Chapter 26 Top-down design

	You will create a bash script which performs the following tasks:
	1. Define stub functions called multiply and divide
	2. Define global variables named int1, int2, and result
	3. Perform the multiplication and assign the product to result.  Print the result.
	4. Perform the division and assign the quotient to result.  Print the result.

	When it is run, the output should look similar to the one shown below:

	DEBUG: multiply ()
	14 * 7 = 98
	DEBUG: divide ()
	14 / 7 = 2

	3.1 	Using vi, create script3.sh and define stub functions for multiply and divide 	functions (No need to paste the commands for steps 3.1 through 3.4)                    

	3.2 	Define the global variables, int1, int2, and result.  Assign the value of 14, 7, 		and 0 to each respectively.

	3.3 	In multiply() function, perform the multiplication and assign the product to 	result.  Print the result.

	3.4 	In divide() function, perform the division and assign the quotient to result.  		Print the result.  Note that int1 is the numerator.

	3.5 	Run you script and make sure it displays correctly.  Paste the output.
. script3.sh
	3.6	Paste the content of script3.sh here
#!/bin/bash

int1=14
int2=7
result=0

multiply () {
    result=$((int1*int2))
    echo 'DEBUG: multiply ()'
    echo $int1 \* $int2 = $result
    return
}

divide () {
    result=$((int1/int2))
    echo 'DEBUG: divide ()'
    echo $int1 \/ $int2 = $result
    return
}

multiply
divide
