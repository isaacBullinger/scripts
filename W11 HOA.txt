	1.4 	Add another printer called test_printer2 from the command line by entering the 		following command: sudo lpadmin -p test_printer2 -E -v ipp://1.2.3.4

sudo lpadmin -p test_printer2 -E -v ipp://1.2.3.4

	1.5 	Check the status of the printers from the command line

lpstat -a

	1.6 	Using the lp command, print the pr_test file to the test_printer2

lp -d test_printer2 pr_test

	1.7	Display the print queue 

lpq -a

	1.8 	Cancel the print job in the test_printer2 printer queue

cancel 1

	1.9 	Using the lpr command, print the pr_test file to test_printer2

lpr -P test_printer2 pr_test

	1.10 	Using the lpq command, display the print queue in test_printer2

lpq -P test_printer2

	1.11 	Using lprm command, remove the print job from test_printer2
	
lprm 1

	1.12	Remove test_printer2 using the following command: sudo lpadmin -x test_printer2

sudo lpadmin -x test_printer2

	1.13 	Remove test_printer1 using the CUPS web portal.  Start a web browser (e.g. 		FireFox) on Ubuntu and open a webpage at http://localhost:631.

gunzip Python-3.10.10.tgz; tar -xf Python-3.10.10.tar

	2.3	Change your directory to the new Python-x.x.x directory

	2.4	View the contents of the directories and read the README file

less README.rst

	2.5	Using "sudo apt install" command, installing the following libraries that Python depends on: build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev curl

sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev curl

	2.6	Run the configure shell script

./configure

	2.7	Run the make command to set everything up.  It will take some time to complete.

make

	2.8	Run the "sudo make install" command to install the program.  It will take some 		time to complete.

sudo make install

	2.9 	Verify that the Python install worked using the "python3 -version" command
